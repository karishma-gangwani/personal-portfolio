Attributions
============

This project uses a small set of third-party resources. Below is a concise list and what you need to know as a developer or non-developer reviewing the repo.

- UI components: `shadcn/ui` (MIT) — used as a design reference and for component patterns. License: MIT. Link: https://ui.shadcn.com/
- Images: Unsplash — free to use under Unsplash license. Link: https://unsplash.com/license

If you need a fuller, verbatim attribution list (for legal/marketing), keep a copy of the original Figma/asset sources and add an `ATTRIBUTIONS_FULL.md` file. The short summary above is sufficient for most developer and reviewer workflows.
